# Assets

The app logos and feature graphic were made in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).

The screenshots were taken from a Pixel 6 API 33 emulator in Android Studio using this [script](../scripts/record_screenshots.sh).

The store listing screenshot mockups were made with [AppMockUp](https://app-mockup.com/).
