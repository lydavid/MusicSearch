# Unicode

Read https://tonsky.me/blog/unicode/ today.

Afterwards, I looked over the flag emoji code and found that the ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡º flag emoji ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡º is made up of 4
code points,
the first 2 code points makes up ğŸ‡ª and the last 2 code points make up ğŸ‡º.
Together, these render as the EU flag on Android, but doesn't seem to when I copy and pasted
"\uD83C\uDDEA\uD83C\uDDFA" without the quotes into my text editor.
