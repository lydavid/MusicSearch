# Key

After commenting out `key = lazyPagingItems.itemKey { it.id },`:

```
java.lang.AssertionError: Failed to perform isDisplayed check.
Reason: Expected exactly '1' node but found '2' nodes that satisfy: (Text + EditableText contains 'Ontario' (ignoreCase: false))
Nodes found:
1) Node #127 at (l=42.0, t=443.0, r=1038.0, b=560.0)px
   Text = '[held events:, Ontario]'
   Actions = [GetTextLayoutResult]
   MergeDescendants = 'true'
2) Node #136 at (l=42.0, t=602.0, r=1038.0, b=719.0)px
   Text = '[held events:, Ontario]'
   Actions = [GetTextLayoutResult]
   MergeDescendants = 'true'
```

Seems like this relationship appears twice in our tests

Seems like the same data is duplicated in our relationships screen

## Solution
We had set up our primary keys for the relation table incorrectly.
After cross-referencing the old and new database schema using the generated svg, we found the relation table
and several other tables did not have a primary key.

So, the fix was as simple as setting up primary keys for all of the tables missing them.
