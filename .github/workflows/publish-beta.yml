name: Publish beta build

# This runs every night,
# so we can expect a new beta release in Google Play if we made any commits during the day.
# However, we may not always get a new GitHub release. That is decided by semantic release.
# eg. If only chores were committed, then there would be no new GitHub release.
# Google Play allows us to reuse versionName, so it isn't a problem for our releases to be out of sync.
