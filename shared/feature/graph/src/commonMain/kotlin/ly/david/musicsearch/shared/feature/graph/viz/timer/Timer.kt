 * to invoke the given callback after a delay; if delay is not specified, it

 *
 * The delay is relative to the specified time in milliseconds;
 * if time is not specified, it defaults to now.
 *
 * The callback is passed the (apparent) elapsed time since the timer became active.
 *
 * (The exact values may vary depending on your JavaScript runtime and what else
 * your computer is doing.)
 *
 * Note that the first elapsed time is 3ms: this is the elapsed time since the
 * timer started, not since the timer was scheduled. Here the timer started 150ms
 * after it was scheduled due to the specified delay. The apparent elapsed time may
 * be less than the true elapsed time if the page is backgrounded and requestAnimationFrame
 * is paused; in the background, apparent time is frozen.If timer is called within the
 * callback of another timer, the new timer callback (if eligible as determined by the
 * specified delay and time) will be invoked immediately at the end of the current frame,
 * rather than waiting until the next frame. Within a frame, timer callbacks are guaranteed
 * to be invoked in the order they were scheduled, regardless of their start time.
